# Museum-of-BROLLYS
Created as a project on the Udemy course " The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele. This uses some bootstrap features but most of the appearence is done with CSS. A touch of javascript that I don't understand yet.

I've managed to make the NavBAr go from Invisible>Solid on scroll, but it doesn't work on larger resolutions so I need to look into that when I have more time. This udemy course is just a bit of fun on the side as I complete my computer science degree.

If I come back to this project, I will add forms to the 'tickets' page.
